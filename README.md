## Hey, I'm Trixy 👋

I’m a full-stack software developer with several years of experience in the JavaScript ecosystem. I also have
hands-on experience developing applications in the AI space . Recently, I co-created Burrow (burrow-io.github.io ), an open source data ingestion pipeline that streamlines the development of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications.

I also built **ShutterBot**, a RAG chatbot using **OpenAI, Python, FastAPI + React** to answer questions about your camera manual.

In my free time, I enjoy exercising outdoors and playing video games such as Overwatch and Stardew Valley.
