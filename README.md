## Hey, I'm Trixy 👋 😄

I’m a full-stack developer with several years of experience in the JavaScript ecosystem, with additional experience
integrating AI technologies into web applications. Recently, I co-created [Burrow](https://burrow-io.github.io), an open source data ingestion pipeline for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems.

I also built **ShutterBot** 📷, a RAG chatbot that answers your questions about your camera manual (inspired after struggling to learn how to use my new camera by having to dig through its dense documentation).

In my free time, I enjoy exercising outdoors and playing video games such as Overwatch and Stardew Valley 👩‍🌾.
