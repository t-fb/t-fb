## Hey, I'm Trixy 👋 😄

I’m a full-stack software developer based in Vancouver, BC with several years of experience in the JavaScript ecosystem. I also have
hands-on experience developing applications in the AI space . Recently, I co-created [Burrow](https://burrow-io.github.io), an open source data ingestion pipeline that streamlines the development of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications.

I also built **ShutterBot** 📷, a RAG chatbot that answers your questions about your camera manual (inspired after struggling to learn how to use my new camera by having to dig through its dense documentation).

In my free time, I enjoy exercising outdoors and playing video games such as Overwatch and Stardew Valley 👩‍🌾.
